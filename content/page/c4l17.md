For [Code4Lib 2017](http://2017.code4lib.org/), I created a poster looking at some tools for static website generation. Below is the poster text, with some added notes.

## Static Website Generators: An Overview

A static website is made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It does not use any server-side language, and is delivered to the end user as it exists on the web server.

A static website generator is a tool that is used to create these websites.

These tools can be well suited for blogs, project overviews, documentation, conference sites, or collection highlights.

### Some benefits of using static generators include:

* No back-end scripting or databases required
* Often more secure (compared to content management systems)
* Most are open-source
* Excellent performance
* Built-in servers for development
* Pre-built theme options
* Quick to create simple sites (once you know how to use the tool)

### Some drawbacks of using static generators include:

* Lack of visual editing environment (but development is happening in this area)
* Some have a large number of dependencies
* Can be challenging to manage for larger sites
* Some have poor extensibility
* More difficult to install in Windows environments

### A static website generator typically consists of...[**](https://css-tricks.com/really-makes-static-site-generator)

* A template language(s) for creating page templates
* A lightweight markup language (e.g. Markdown) for creating content
* A structure and markup (e.g. YAML) for providing configuration and metadata
* A set of rules or structure for organizing and naming files that are exported/compiled, files that are not, and how these files are handled
* A way to compile templates and markup into HTML (generally support for CSS or JavaScript preprocessors is also included)
* A built-in server for testing and development
